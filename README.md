# Fibonacci Sequence ZK Circuit in Rust

This project implements a Zero-Knowledge (ZK) circuit for computing Fibonacci sequences using the Halo2 APIs in Rust. The purpose of this project is solely for personal learning and curiosity about zero-knowledge proofs and the implementation of zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge).
